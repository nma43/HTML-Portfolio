<h1>The Best Movies According to Nick</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>This movie has the highest IMDb rating of all time, and it is well deserved. Super emotional movie.</p>
<h3>How to train your dragon</h3>
<p>This is my favorite animated movie. It has a nice story with good music too.</p>
<h3>Mission Impossible</h3>
<p>I'd have to be a fool to not include MI in the top 3. Top-class Tom Cruise action.</p>
